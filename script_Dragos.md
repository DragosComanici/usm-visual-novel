# Inside Watchtower
With a creak of the door you enter the dilapidated watchtower. A smell of old dust hits your nose as you notice the rundown interior of the first room. Worn tapestries, broken furniture and a dusty wooden floor with an ugly rug is all you notice at a first glance. The Princess must be somewhere in this tower and you don’t know how much time she has left. There is a staircase to the upper levels of the watchtower.

-Explore
You look through some of the broken furniture and find what looks to be a half-full jug of oil.

# Go Upstairs
You walk up the cobblestone stairs and end up at the door to the second floor.

- Open Door Quickly (#Waking Dragon)
You open the door in a hurry, trying to get to the princess as quickly as possible but the rusty hinges make an awful squeaking noise. Entering the room you are met with the sight of the evil Dragon, sleeping in the middle of the room, taking much of the space. The Dragon is startled from it’s sleep from the noise and notices you. It roars with a terrifying sound and prepares for a fight.

- Oil The Door (#Sleeping Dragon)
You oil the rusty hinges before you open the door, not wanting to make any noise. You enter and are met with a sleeping evil Dragon taking much of the space in the room snoring and oblivious to your presence.

# Waking Dragon
The Dragon starts thrashing and bashing against you as you try to dodge it’s attacks. Much of what remains in this rundown room gets further destroyed. The struggle lasts for what almost feels like an eternity as the Dragon’s attacks get harder and harder to avoid. Right when you think there is no way to beat it, you see an opening; the Dragon sits up on it’s hind legs, it’s head preparing for a decisive bite attack, but in doing so, exposing it’s underbelly, it’s weak spot. You could take your chance here and attack it, or it might be smarter to dodge this strong attack, leaving the Dragon’s defense open.

- Attack (Game Over)
You rush up to the beast’s belly, ready to cut it open, but as you do, the Dragon lunges it’s head and grabs you in it’s maw, it’s bite to fast to avoid. Within moments… you are dead. The End.

- Dodge
You muster what little energy you have left and roll out of the way, between the Dragon’s legs, as it manages to bite nothing but the room wall. Now, with superior positioning, you cut right above you and slice open the underbelly of the Dragon, covering you in blood. It roars and screams in pain as it stumbles across the room, bashing itself against everything then falls and dies near the wall. You catch your breath after a hard fought victory. 

# Princess Room (Bad Ending)
You continue up the stairs to the attic of the watchtower. Behind the door you hear heavy breathing. You bust open the door and see the frightened Princess sitting in the corner of a daylight lit room with a clutched dagger in her hands, she must’ve heard the commotion downstairs. The room is not as disheveled as the rest, in fact it almost looks homely were it not for the dust and cobwebs. She looks at you with a terrified gaze.

- Comfort Her (Game Over)
You try to calm down the Princess, telling her the evil Dragon is dead and that you are here to save her and bring her home safe. She doesn’t usher a word, but simply let’s down her dagger, but still clutching it in one hand. “That’s okay” you think to yourself. “She must still be terrified after being kidnapped”. You gesture her to follow you as you start heading downstairs, but as you do you hear the rush of footsteps right behind you and before you can turn, you feel the sharp cold steal of a dagger piercing your back. You fall down, your vision getting darker. The last thing you see is the Princess staring at you with a seemingly disappointed and sorrowful face before continuing walking down the stairs. You can’t help but wonder as to why she did that, but your life fades before you can come up with an answer. The End.

# Sleeping Dragon
After mustering your heart at the sight of this terrifying beast you notice the stairs that lead to what seems to be the attic of the Watchtower. You try to can sneak past the Dragon and go to the attic, or you can attack the Dragon while it’s sleeping.

- Attack
You slowly unsheathe your sword and walk up to the head of the sleeping Dragon. However, on the way, you accidentally step on a creaky floorboard and as you look up from your foot where to stepped, you see an angry Dragon staring at you. The Dragon pushes you way with it’s wing and the two of you get ready to fight. (See #Waking Dragon)

- Sneak
Slowly. Bit by bit. Holding your breath tight in your lungs, you make your way up the attic stairs, praying with each step that nothing creaks underneath you. You gently open the door to the attic and enter.

# Princess Room (Neutral Ending)
Inside you spot the Princess. She is sitting at a table, writing on a piece of paper. This room is in a much better shape than the other ones you’ve been in. There’s even a sleeping cot and a painting stand with a freshly drawn painting. The Princess startles from you entering. You calm her down and gesture her to not make any noise so that you don’t wake up the Dragon. You explain to her that you’re there to save her and tell her to carefully follow you.
The Princess looks frantically through the room and says “Wait, you don’t understand”. ”We don’t have time”, you reply to her. “Your father, the King, is deeply worried about you”, you add. The Princess averts her gaze and looks down slightly with a seemingly disappointed and frustrated look. She seems quite reluctant to leave for some reason. After a few seconds, with a deep sigh, she stands up and follows you. The two of you make your way down. Before heading to the first floor, you see the Princess look at the Dragon with a more sad expression rather than terrified. You whisper to her to keep moving. The two of you make your way out of the watchtower and continue on going back to the Kingdom. 
Along the trip the Princess doesn’t usher a single word, instead simply looking sadly at the ground, following you. You brush it off. After all, you saved the princess and the King is sure to give you a big reward for it. The End.
