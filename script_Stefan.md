# Start
You travel along an old cobbled path, the hills around you calm and tranquil. The morning sun kindly kisses your face as you move to your objective.

You are here to save the princess from a dragon. A noble goal fit for a noble knight. You got your assignment from the king himself.

Straightforward. Simple. Surely you will not find any challenge too hard to overcome? 

At last you see your destination in the distance. A derelict tower, long abandoned, long forgotten. No wender a vile dragon is hiding here.

- (Proceed to the tower)
You take a moment to prepare yourself and approach the watchtower. Whatever the fates have prepared for you, it is in the tower.
-> **# Outside watchtower**

- (Turn back) 
You turn back.
-> **# Lazy end**

# Lazy end
It might seem unsightly to turn back, after coming all this way, but at heart you are a coward. The king seemed too composed when sending you, too uncaring.

Something is not right. 

Caution is the better part of valor. You will say the tower was empty, princess absent and no dragon to be seen. You will receive no reward, but gold is of little consequence. You value your life more.

The end.
