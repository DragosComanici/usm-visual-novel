# Start
You travel along an old cobbled path, the hills around you calm and tranquil. The morning sun kindly kisses your face as you move to your objective.

You are here to save the princess from a dragon. A noble goal fit for a noble knight. You got your assignment from the king himself.

Straightforward. Simple. Surely you will not find any challenge too hard to overcome? 

At last you see your destination in the distance. A derelict tower, long abandoned, long forgotten. No wender a vile dragon is hiding here.

- (Proceed to the tower)
You take a moment to prepare yourself and approach the watchtower. Whatever the fates have prepared for you, it is in the tower.
-> **Outside watchtower**

- (Turn back) 
You turn back.
-> **Lazy end**

# Lazy end
It might seem unsightly to turn back, after coming all this way, but at heart you are a coward. The king seemed too composed when sending you, too uncaring.

Something is not right. 

Caution is the better part of valor. You will say the tower was empty, princess absent and no dragon to be seen. You will receive no reward, but gold is of little consequence. You value your life more.

The end.

# Outside watchtower
You cautiosly approach the stone building. The stone bricks are overgrown with moss, and many are scattered around broken.

There is not doubt in your mind that this place was abandoned many years ago. Yet now there is a princess, captured within the towers walls. You ponder what your next step should be.

- (Explore) Investigate the surroundings 
You take your time to circle the tower, looking for anything of interest in the area.

After little time you find a small hatch leading below the tower. It seems there is a small cellar underneath. You find no other points of interest.

- (Explore first to unlock) Enter the cellar.
You open the small hatch and it screetches in protest. But it opens all the same. The sun behind your provides a little light as you descend underground.
-> **Watchtower Cellar**

- Enter the tower
You are sure of your purpose, you are here to save the princess. Mulling around will not change that. You stride towards the door of the watchtower, pry it open and step inside.
-> **Inside watchtower**

- Yell
You don't beat around the bush, you yell out for the princess hoping she will respond and let you know where she is.

No such luck, instead of the fair voice of the princess what responds to your plea is the mighty roar of the beast. You unsheathe your sword and grab your shield just in time as the dragon flies out a window halfway up the watchtower and plunges to the ground.
-> **Dragon Fight**
